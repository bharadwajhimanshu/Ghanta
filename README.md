# Ghanta

When Windows Phone was released, to understand how different sensors work, I wrote an app called 'Ghanta'. It was pretty popular. The idea was to showcase how Accelerometer works in mobile devices :)

Meanwhile, a lot has changed. There was Windows Store Project and now we have Universal Windows Platform projects. We also have Xamarin.Forms which supports cross-platform native mobile app development for Android, iOS and UWP.

So, I thought to rewrite the 'Ghanta' app and make it open source. 

This app cross-platform mobile application is built using Xamarin.Forms 3.0 and Visual Studio 2017 IDE. Following NuGet packages are used for added functionality:

* Xamarin.Essentials
* SimpleAudioPlayer
* AppCenter (Crashes and Analytics)

Feel free to download, modify, send PRs if you think this code can be improved. 

Namaste,
